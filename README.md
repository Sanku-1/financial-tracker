# Project Title
Financial Tracker/Ledger Application

## Description of the Project

Briefly describe what this Java console application does. Mention its purpose and who the intended users are. Explain the main functionality and what problems it aims to solve.

## User Stories
- As a business owner, I want users' ledger search parameters to be saved and timestamped, so that they can be easily accessed and reused later.
- As a business owner, I want the ledger to display the newest entries first, so that users can view the most recent transactions at a glance
- As a business owner, I want the home screen to give the user the option to add deposits, make payments, view their ledger, and exit the application, so that users can navigate to the core functions of the program easily.
- As a business owner, I want the ledger to have multiple user options regarding what content to display, specifically one that displays all entries, one that displays deposits, one that displays payments, and one that displays reports, so that the user can easily filter the entries to better suit their needs.
- As a business owner, I want users to be able to generate reports based on certain criteria/time frames, such as Month to date, previous month, year to date, previous year, and search by vendor, so that they will be able to further filter transactions and view the information easily.
- As a business owner, I want users to be able to go back to the previous page when navigating the menu system, as well as for them to be able to exit the application if they're on the Home Screen, so that they can seamlessly navigate the menu structure of the application.
- As a business owner, I want users to be able to view the tracker in a more visible way using a GUI, so that they're not stuck using the IDE console.
